### System scripts

This repo holds some system scripts I use in configuration of my Ubuntu laptop.

#### acpi/lock-screen.sh

This script can be run as root to lock all X-sessions of all users.
You can run it by acpid: create /etc/acpi/events/XXXXX for that.

#### xdg-screensaver

This is a stock Ubuntu 13.10 xdg-screensaver with added support for MATE and its mate-screensaver.
